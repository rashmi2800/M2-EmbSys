## Discription:
A smartwatch must be able to solve typical human issues in addition to having a clock and connection. Health monitoring is an important application. Smartwatches currently count steps and pace, as well as the amount of kilometres run, but monitoring heartbeat, blood pressure, and body temperature adds to the device's utility.

## Component Discrpition

### Power source
The battery powers all of the devices, switches, and the microprocessor. A good battery is one that lasts a long time, can be recharged, and does not overheat or catch fire.

### Power Buttons
Helps us in Switching on the device.

### Controller 
Ensures that our system's functions are performed.

### LCD
They serve as a means of interaction with the user.

### ADC 
Converts the Analog signal to Digital Signal.

### Temperature Sensors
To determine the room's temperature.

### Bluetooth
Bluetooth allows you to connect your watch to your phone. Your devices are now connected, and you'll see notifications from your smartphone on your watch's screen.

### Sensors
Heartbeat and Step Measurement sensors: Smart watches and wrist-worn fitness trackers that helps in estimatation our heart rate as well as they keep a count of steps.

### Accelerometer
Most smartwatches have accelerometers, which track whether you're walking, jogging, cycling, or sleeping by measuring how movement changes over time.

### Biomems Sensors
These sesnors monitors pulse rate and Blood flow in our body.


# V MODEL

## Concept of operation
A smartwatch is a digital watch. The watch contains a small computer that runs on its own operating system. Smart watches allows us to perform actions by tapping or swiping on the screen. Modern smartwatches include several apps, similar to apps for smartphones and tablets.


## Low Level Requirements
 
* Power Buttons to switch the system on/off.
* With the help of the battery the power is supplied to the Microcontroller, Sensors


## High Level Requirements

* To detect the room Temperature using temperature sensors.
* Monitor pulse rate and heart beat rate using biomems sensors.
* Measuring the movement of our body accurately using accelerometers.
* To make decisions whether to turn ON/OFF or go in sleep mode.

## Test cases
 
* Is power being supplied to the decives? (Y/N)
* Are the sesnors working properly?(Y/N)
* All the actions given by the user are performed accuretly? (Y/N)
* Is the decision made by the microcontroller to turn of or going to sleep mode is correct? (Y/N)
