## Description:
A smartwatch must be able to solve typical human issues in addition to having a clock and connection. Health monitoring is an important application. Smartwatches currently count steps and pace, as well as the amount of kilometres run, but monitoring heartbeat, blood pressure, and body temperature adds to the device's utility.

## Component Descrpition

### Power source
The battery powers all of the devices, switches, and the microprocessor. A good battery is one that lasts a long time, can be recharged, and does not overheat or catch fire.

### Power Buttons
Helps us in Switching on the device.

### Controller 
Ensures that our system's functions are performed.

### LCD
They serve as a means of interaction with the user.

### ADC 
Converts the Analog signal to Digital Signal.

### Temperature Sensors
To determine the room's temperature.

### Bluetooth
Bluetooth allows you to connect your watch to your phone. when  devices are connected, and we can see notifications from our smartphone on watch's screen.

### Sensors
Heartbeat and Step Measurement sensors: Smart watches and wrist-worn fitness trackers that helps in estimatation our heart rate as well as they keep a count of steps.

### Accelerometer
Most smartwatches have accelerometers, which track whether you're walking, jogging, cycling, or sleeping by measuring how movement changes over time.

### Biomems Sensors
These sensors monitors pulse rate and Blood flow in our body.


# V MODEL

## Concept of operation
A smartwatch is a digital watch. The watch contains a small computer that runs on its own operating system. Smart watches allows us to perform actions by tapping or swiping on the screen. Modern smartwatches include several apps, similar to apps for smartphones and tablets.


## Low Level Requirements
 
* Power Buttons to switch the system on/off.
* With the help of the battery the power is supplied to the Microcontroller, Sensors


## High Level Requirements

* To detect the room Temperature using temperature sensors.
* Monitor pulse rate and heart beat rate using biomems sensors.
* Measuring the movement of our body accurately using accelerometers.
* To make decisions whether to turn ON/OFF or go in sleep mode.

## Test cases
 
* Is power being supplied to the devices? (Y/N)
* Are the sesnors working properly?(Y/N)
* All the actions given by the user are performed accuretly? (Y/N)
* Is the decision made by the microcontroller to turn of or going to sleep mode is correct? (Y/N)

## Description:
Wireless headphones are headphones that connect to a device without the use of a wire or cable, such as a smartphone, stereo speaker, television, gaming console, computer, or other electronic device. Wireless headphones work by sending audio signals via radio or infrared (IR) signals, depending on the device.

## Component Descrpition

### Power source
The battery powers all of the devices, switches, and the microprocessor.

### Power Buttons
Helps us in Switching on the device.

### Micro Controller Unit 
Performs all the important operations and helps headphones perform all the operations correctly without any damages by controlling all the inputs and outputs accordingly.

### LCD
Blinks into different colours to indicate whether the headphones are on or off.

### Bluetooth
Bluetooth acts as communication interface between the input audio(user) and headphones which allows us to connect to your phone. 

### ADC 
Converts the Analog signal to Digital Signals.

### DAC 
Converts the Digital signals to Analog Signals.

### Sensors
In headphones, sensors such as motion sensors are present, which aid in the control of headphones via gesture as well as the proper placement of earphones in the ears.

### Mic
Mics allows us to adjust the volume, answer and end calls, mute the audio, or skip tracks on your music player or smartphone.

### Speaker
Speakers acts as output to the user, these let us listen to an audio source privately.

# V MODEL

## Concept of operation
Wireless headphones work by connecting, or pairing with the device you want to use through a radio or infrared signal. Devices with Bluetooth technology can connect and exchange data over very short distances using radio transmissions.

## Low Level Requirements
* Switches to turn ON/OFF the system.
* To display the results using LCD.
* Power Supply to the Microcontroller, Sensors and motor.

## High Level Requirements
* To detect gestures and act accordingly.
* To amplify the audio properly.
* To notify user about calls or messeges.
* To make decisions whether to turn ON/OFF.

## Tast cases
* Is power being supplied to the devices? (Y/N)
* All the components are working properly? (Y/N)
* Is bluetooth is connected properly? (Y/N)
* Proper amplification of audio id done? (Y/N)
* Is the decision made by the microcontroller to turn of or going to sleep mode is correct? (Y/N)
